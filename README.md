### Abstract
 Ultra-reliable, low-latency communication (URLLC), is one of three service categories in
troduced by 3GPP for 5G and beyond. In order to meet the strict latency requirements of
 1ms or less, packet length must be short. This presents a major challenge as fundamental
 information theory has shown that in order to achieve high reliability (low error probability)
 infinitely long blocklength is required.

 As a consequence Shannonâ€™s capacity expression no longer holds true for short packet, finite
 blocklength communications. In order to gain insight and develop methods to tackle these
 challenges facing URLLC communication, a factory automation scenario is considered. A
 base station must deliver a packet each to two actuators. Under this model expressions are
 derived to aid investigation of blocklength and power allocation between multiple users in
 an orthogonal multiple access (OMA) downlink system.

 Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has received much attention of late for its charac
teristics which are suggested to be suitable for URLLC applications. Following this NOMA
 expressions are derived and under the same system model OMA and NOMA are compared.
 Algorithms are then proposed to allocate resources such that sum throughput is maximised.
 
 To conclude numerical simulation results show the performance of the algorithms proposed
 and in which base station (BS) transmit power regions they have significant impact.
 The principal results of this thesis show that NOMA has desirable characteristics for URLLC
 applications, including higher sum throughput and also lower latency, when compared to
 OMA. The algorithms proposed are compared with equal allocation and exhaustive search
 allocation optimization methods. The simulation results show that the algorithms proposed
 achieve performance very close to global optimum.

 Based off the simulations some conclusions are made as regards when there is a performance
 gain to be had by optimization and when optimization yields little performance gain. Some
 areas for future work are also suggested as URLLC and finite blocklength communication
 is still in its infancy and requires significant work before it will be practically applicable.
